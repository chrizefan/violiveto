# **Master Business Plan: Agriturismo Violiveto**

This document is the definitive master file for the Podere Cerreto project, encompassing agricultural strategy, property revitalization, a multi-jurisdictional corporate structure, and the EU-based residency process.

## **1\. Diversified Agricultural Production Strategy**

Revenue sources are split to ensure year-round cash flow and aesthetic appeal for the hospitality segment.

### **Saffron (Red Gold)**

* **Target:** 3.5 kg annual yield by 2030; boutique price target of €27,500/kg.1  
* **Agronomics:** Requires approx. 2,900 manual labor hours per year, providing the "labor shield" necessary to maintain the Wife's IAP (Professional Farmer) status.1  
* **Cycle:** Planting in August; intensive flowering/harvest in October/November.3

### **Lavender (Blue Gold)**

* **Target:** High-margin essential oil production (Gross Margin \>85%).5  
* **Yields:** 8–30 kg of oil/ha for True Lavender; up to 220 kg/ha for Lavandin hybrids.  
* **Synergy:** Enhances the estate's visual branding during peak summer tourism (June–July) when saffron is dormant.5

**2\. Property Revitalization & Detailed Renovations**

The renovation of the 144 m² main house and 140 m² annex focuses on creating seven luxury en-suite units.

### **Home Renovation Line-Item Cost Estimates (2025/2026)**

| Line Item | Unit Metric | Est. Cost (Materials \+ Labor) | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Plumbing** | Per Water Point (*Punto Acqua*) | €160 – €180 |  |
| **Electrical** | Per Light/Outlet Point (*Punto Luce*) | €20 – €50 |  |
| **Kitchen Fit-out** | Complete Installation | €3,000 – €5,000 |  |
| **Bathroom (Full)** | Per Unit (10m²) | €8,000 – €10,000 |  |
| **Flooring (Gres)** | Per Square Meter | €40 – €120 |  |
| **Interior Painting** | Per Square Meter | €5 – €30 |  |
| **Roofing (Insulated)** | Per Square Meter | €180 – €200 |  |
| **Structural/Masonry** | Per Square Meter (Internal walls) | €40 – €70 |  |

### **Budget-Optimized Pool Restoration**

The previous €175,000 budget is considered excessive. We recommend these high-durability, lower-cost alternatives:

* **Aggregate/Pebble Finish:** A "Pebble Tec" style finish provides a luxury look for **€5,000 – €15,000** and lasts 15–20 years.  
* **High-End Vinyl Liner:** A 28mm reinforced liner costs **€1,200 – €3,800** and offers a 10–15 year lifespan.  
* **Salt-Water Conversion:** Retrofitting an existing system for salt-water/sand filtration typically costs **€1,000 – €3,000**.6

**3\. Business Architecture & Multi-Jurisdictional Tax Planning**

The structure uses three pillars to separate the farm, events, and global consulting/trading.

### **Pillar 1: Agriturismo Violiveto (SSA)**

* **Entity:** *Società Semplice Agricola* (owned by both, run by Wife).  
* **Benefit:** IAP certification allows for **100% tax exemption** on agricultural sales and a fixed 25% taxable base for hospitality revenue.

### **Pillar 2: Events & Experience (Service SRL)**

* **Entity:** Italian Limited Liability Company (under Husband).  
* **Purpose:** Manages high-margin weddings and corporate retreats. This keeps hospitality revenue within the 50% "prevalenza" cap for the farm's tax status.8

### **Pillar 3: AI Consulting & Trading (Estonian OÜ)**

* **Entity:** Private Limited Company (OÜ) via Estonian e-Residency.  
* **Tax Strategy:** Estonia taxes only **distributed profits** (22% in 2026).  
* **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE (Esterovestizione):** Under Italian law, if the "place of effective management" (the person making decisions) is in Italy, the Estonian company may be deemed an **Italian tax resident**.9  
  * **Recommendation:** To mitigate this, ensure the OÜ has actual economic substance in Estonia (e.g., local contractors or an office) or keep consulting income below €85k and use the Italian *Regime Forfettario* (5-15% tax), which is often safer and cheaper for solo professionals living in Italy.11

**4\. Immigration Framework (EU Citizen & Spouse)**

Your Romanian citizenship significantly simplifies the move, bypassing the *Decreto Flussi* quota system.

### **For the Husband (Romanian/EU)**

* **Right of Abode:** You enter Italy freely. Within 8 days, you should notify the local police (*Dichiarazione di presenza*), and after 90 days, you must register with the local *Anagrafe* (Registry Office).1  
* **Requirement:** Show proof of "self-sufficiency" (funds or work contract).1

### **For the Wife (Non-EU Spouse)**

* **Pathway:** *Coesione Familiare* (Family Cohesion).  
* **Action:** Apply for the **"Carta di Soggiorno di familiare di un cittadino dell'Unione"** (valid for 5 years).  
* **Requirements:** Registered/transcribed marriage certificate, proof of cohabitation, and a minimum family income of approx. **€11,000**.  
* **Benefit:** Grants her immediate right to work and manage the agriturismo.
