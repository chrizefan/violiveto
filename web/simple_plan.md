**1\. Executive Summary**

The establishment of **Agriturismo Violiveto** represents a strategic transition of the Podere Cerreto property into a highly efficient agricultural and hospitality business. The agriturismo structure is the decisive winner for this project, offering an estimated **€218,500 to €288,500 in total financial advantage** over a 10-year period compared to a standard B\&B model. This advantage is driven by an effective tax rate of approximately 6% on hospitality revenue, a 0% tax rate on agricultural product sales, and access to substantial EU/Regional grants through the CSR Umbria program.  
\+1

Key highlights include:

* **Total Project Investment:** Estimated at €1,290,800 to €1,445,800, covering purchase, transaction costs, luxury renovations, and business setup.

* **Tax Efficiency:** Agriculture sales are 100% tax-exempt, and only 25% of hospitality revenue is subject to income tax.  
  \+1

* **Grant Potential:** Access to €80,000 to €120,000 (conservative) in subsidies for renovations, young farmer setup, and environmental stewardship.  
  \+1

* **Property Match:** The 24-hectare estate perfectly satisfies the legal requirements for "Imprenditore Agricolo" (Agricultural Entrepreneur) status.

## ---

**2\. Property Overview & Legal Documentation**

The property, formerly known as Podere Cerreto, is a prestigious rural estate located at Podere Cerreto 7, Località Cerreto, Castel Viscardo (TR), Umbria.

### **2.1 Legal & Physical Status**

* **Owner:** Riccardo Testa.

* **Land Area:** Approximately 24 hectares across multiple parcels.

* **Zoning:** Primarily Zone "E" (Agricultural) with hydrogeological constraints and portions of Zone "E3" (Wooded). This zoning fully supports agriturismo activities under local Umbrian regulations (L.R. 1/2015).  
  \+1

* **Built Area:** Total of 530 m², including a main house and an annex.

  * **Main House:** 144 m², Category A/2 (Luxury/Prestige classification).

  * **Annex:** 140 m², Category C/4 (Warehouse), currently undergoing conversion to residential use by the seller.

* **Layout:** 7 bedrooms (6 double, 1 twin) and 7 bathrooms, ideal for a hospitality operation with 4 guest apartments and 1 owner residence.  
  \+1

* **Energy Status:** APE Class E, with a non-renewable energy consumption of 214 kWh/m²/year.

* **Habitability:** Agibilità was requested in 2008 and approved on April 1, 2009\.

### **2.2 Sourced Documentation Summary**

The following documents have been verified as part of the due diligence process:  
\+1

* **Visura per Soggetto (18/07/2022):** Confirms ownership, land parcels, and property rendita.

* **Certificato di Destinazione Urbanistica (05/05/2010):** Confirms zoning and agricultural compatibility.

* **APE (20/01/2025):** Energy performance certificate provided by Dario Pellegrini.

* **Agibilità Record (21/09/2008):** Includes conformity declarations for systems and scarichi (sewerage).

**3\. The Business Case: Agriturismo vs. B\&B**

A detailed comparison reveals that the agriturismo structure is the only viable model for a property of this scale and your revenue goals.

### **3.1 Why B\&B is Suboptimal**

* **Revenue Limits:** The Regime Forfettario (flat-rate tax) is capped at €85,000/year, which your 4-apartment model may quickly exceed.  
  \+1

* **Taxation:** Once above the cap, ordinary tax rates (IRES 24% \+ IRAP 3.9%) apply to net profit, resulting in an effective tax rate of \~21%.

* **Activity Conflict:** A B\&B structure does not integrate agricultural sales (oil, wine) and may be challenged by authorities as inappropriate for a 24-hectare agricultural estate.

* **Property Tax:** B\&Bs are subject to full IMU (€4,000–€7,000/year), whereas agriturismi are often exempt.  
  \+1

### **3.2 The Agriturismo Advantage (Agriturismo Violiveto)**

* **Tax Efficiency:**  
  * **Hospitality:** Only 25% of revenue is taxable. At a 24% IRES rate, the effective rate on gross hospitality income is just 6%.  
    \+1

  * **Agriculture:** Sales of your own products (olive oil, wine, saffron) are **100% tax-exempt**.  
    \+1

* **VAT Benefit:** You are eligible for a 50% VAT reduction on sales, charging 10% but remitting only 5%.  
  \+1

* **Operational Integration:** Allows for the legal sale of farm products and provides access to high-value agricultural grants.  
  \+2

**6\. Agricultural Strategy & Crop Analysis**

To maintain agriturismo status, farming must remain the primary activity. Your 24 hectares offer several high-value opportunities.

### **6.1 Tier 1: Ultra-High Value (Recommended)**

* **Saffron (Crocus sativus):**  
  * **Potential Revenue:** €60,000–€172,000 per hectare.

  * **Strategy:** Start with 0.5 hectares. Production of \~0.6–0.85 kg of dried saffron can yield €15,000–€21,000 in direct sales.

  * **Labor:** Very high (manual harvest) but perfect for "guest experiences".

* **Existing Production:**  
  * **Olive Oil:** \~100L existing production (€1,500/year).

  * **Wine:** \~500 bottles existing DOC production (€6,000/year).

### **6.2 Tier 2: Diversification**

* **Lavender:** 0.5 hectares for essential oils. Yields €5,000–€7,500.

* **Truffles:** If soil conditions are favorable, truffle oaks could yield €20,000–€50,000 per hectare, though production takes 5–7 years to begin.
