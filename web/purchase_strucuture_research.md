### 1. The *Prima Casa* Reality Check: Whole Property vs. Residential Unit

You are correct that moving your residency to the municipality of Castel Viscardo within 18 months of purchase is the trigger to reduce your registration tax from 9% to 2%. However, there is a common misconception about how this applies to farms:

* **It Does Not Apply to the Whole Farm:** The *Prima Casa* (first home) benefit applies **strictly to residential property** and its immediate appurtenances (e.g., a garage or a storage unit). It cannot be applied to your 24 hectares of agricultural land (Zone E) or exclusively commercial/farming annexes.
* **The "Two Units" Hurdle:** The main house at Podere Cerreto is currently divided into two distinct cadastral units, both classified as A/2 (civil dwellings). You can typically only claim *Prima Casa* on *one* of those units, unless you commit to legally merging them into a single cadastral home during the renovation process.

### 2. Protecting Your Non-Agricultural Income

You can breathe easy here. In Italy, spouses are taxed separately on their earned income.

To qualify for the "Imprenditore Agricolo Professionale" (IAP) certification, your wife must individually derive at least 50% of *her* total global income from farming activities. Because your incomes are not legally merged for this specific test, your salary from finance, AI, or other ventures will **not** dilute her agricultural income ratio or jeopardize her IAP status.

### 3. Purchasing Structure Analysis

Choosing how to put your names on the deed is the most critical decision for your wealth preservation. Here is how the different angles play out:

**Option A: Co-ownership as Individuals (Both Names on the Deed)**

* **The Mechanics:** You buy the estate 50/50 as private citizens.
* **Pros:** You both have direct, equal legal ownership of the asset.
* **Cons:** Because *you* do not hold IAP status and have outside income, you cannot access agricultural tax breaks for your half of the land. When buying agricultural land without IAP status, standard registration taxes are exceptionally high (often up to 15% of the land value). You would also owe full IMU (property tax) on your 50% of the agricultural assets, while your wife's half would be exempt.

**Option B: Purchasing in Your Wife’s Name Only**

* **The Mechanics:** Your wife buys the entire estate as a sole proprietor/IAP.
* **Pros:** This is the cleanest route for maximum tax efficiency. Because she is the IAP, the entire land purchase benefits from reduced agricultural transfer taxes, and the farm is fully exempt from IMU.
* **Cons:** You have zero legal ownership of a €1,000,000 asset financed by your family trust. From a wealth-protection standpoint, this is highly undesirable.

**Option C: Registered Business Entity (Società Semplice Agricola - SSA)**

* **The Mechanics:** You form a Simple Agricultural Partnership (SSA) owned by both of you, but administered by your wife.
* **Pros:** An SSA is the standard vehicle for this exact scenario in Italy. Under Italian law, an agricultural partnership qualifies for full IAP status (and all regional grants/tax exemptions) as long as **at least one partner** (your wife) holds the IAP certification. You can own a significant share of the company, and your outside income will not jeopardize the company's IAP standing.
* **Cons:** A company *cannot* claim *Prima Casa* benefits for residential property. If the SSA buys the whole estate, you will pay standard corporate transfer taxes on the residential units instead of the 2% *Prima Casa* rate.

### The Recommendation: The "Split Structure" Approach

To capture both the *Prima Casa* benefits for your home and the IAP benefits for your business, international buyers often execute a **Split Structure**:

1. **The Residential Purchase (Private):** You and your wife purchase the A/2 residential units and the C/6 garage as **private individuals**. This allows you to claim the 2% *Prima Casa* tax rate.
2. **The Agricultural Purchase (Corporate):** You form an **SSA** together. The SSA purchases the 24 hectares of land and the farming annexes (C/4 and C/2). The SSA gets the massive agricultural tax discounts and shields your external income.
3. **The Operations:** You (the individuals) draft a registered lease (*comodato d'uso*) allowing your SSA to use the designated guest rooms for the agriturismo business.

This approach legally protects your equity, insulates your external income, and maximizes every available Italian tax loophole.
